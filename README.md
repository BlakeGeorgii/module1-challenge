#Module 1 Challenge

##Description

The challenge was to optimize and organize existing html and CSS code.
I did this by adding semantic html elements and combining repeating CSS code.
Through the challenge I've realized how comfortable I've gotten reading html and CSS.
The finished project was push to the repository, published on GitHub Pages and turned in through bootcampspot.
